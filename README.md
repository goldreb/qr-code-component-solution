## My process

### What I learned

- I learned how to use the media query such as this challenge. Without the media query the section which contain the image would get bigger as I am adjusting the size of the screen.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
I am proud that I was able to write a code with just using the elements and be
